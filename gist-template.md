This is my tutorial on how to create a gist

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

Regex is short for "regular expressions" and how regex is used is to define a sequence of search pattern. It is usually included in search algorithims to simplify the characters you want to search. It can be used as a simple array such as: [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz], [1234567890], [!@#$%^&*()] or [a-z], [A-Z], [1-0] or if you want to simply your code even further you can also do [a-zA-Z]. You can use regex in creating certain features such as password generators, give variables for passwords, usernames, etc. It is a means to define what characters you can use for anthing that involves generating or creating a unique word.
